## Design and Implementation of Advance Algorithm of GNSS Signal Using Interference Effect

OBJECTIVE :-

In this project we are trying to design and develop algorithms and hardware to sense location using GNSS. 

We would be using the raspberry pi for collecting the data of GPS IMU and NAVIC receivers of a certain area, and analyze the error and accuracy of these parameters.
GPS, IMU data are been observed in static and dynamic mode and NavIC data is observed in static mode. 

The data received may endure from interference such as electromagnetic, atmospheric, and how different satellites change over time. Thus the accuracy may be affected. Therefore, it is necessary to implement some techniques to improve the estimation. 

The datasets from the receivers will be analyzed using Data Science tools such as Python and MS Excel. This dissertation will focus on analyzing signals from GNSS satellites in different locations which we help us to analyze how the data may suffer and vary, we would also implement those variations in the form of graphs using MATLAB and Microsoft Excel. Finally we would be checking how the Interference is applying for the data collected in static and dynamic mode for each receiver separately.
